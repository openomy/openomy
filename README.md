## ✨ Feature

### 1. Contributor chart from a different perspective

Compared to a simple contributor chart, a true contributor list should include more, PR, issue, discussion, and even a small comment, and should not be measured only by code submission. These are all manifestations of community activity! They should all be seen! Therefore, we designed and developed a variety of contributor charts / widgets

[![][widget-banner]][homepage-link]

If your project also wants to access our chart, you can visit http://openomy.com/lobehub/lobe-chat (replace the lobehub/lobe-chat path with your repository path)
Or directly in your github repository, replace `github` with `openomy`

### 2. All activities in the open source repository

Whether you are an important contributor to the project or just like to participate in issues and discussions, you can see all the activities here, even a small like from others.

> A new project-level statistics page will be launched soon

### 3. Unique personal details page「Still in progress」

As a GitHub community user, every little support should be counted and seen, so we designed a special personal page.

> New design draft is on the way, please stay tuned
